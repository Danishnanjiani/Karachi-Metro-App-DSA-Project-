# Karachi-Metro-App-DSA-Project-
A console-based application developed in C++ for a Data Structures and Algorithms course, designed to calculate the shortest path and fare. The app uses graph and tree data structures to model the connections between towns. Users can input their starting and ending locations, and the program outputs the shortest route along with the total cost.
